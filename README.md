# PHYS 2200 Midterm 2 Project

This project was assigned where we were given a working metropolis simulation for a single temperature with a rectangular grid. The code needed to be modified such that instead of simulating a rectangular grid, a triangular grid would be simulated. Additionally, the transition temperature needed to be figured out but running the simulation at multiple temperatures, and then graphing for easily visibility of the transition. For a triangular grid the transition temperature happens to be ~3.7K.

This simulation runs by looking at nearest neighbors and using that to help calculate the next configuration of a location on the grid, in addition to using a random number generator, aproximating the true nature of materials. The simulation starts with all spins alligned, i.e. a cold start.
